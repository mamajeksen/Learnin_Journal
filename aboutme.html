                    <p>
                        After a several month of being a super organized Mom of my first born, we decided
                        to have a second baby. This changed a lot, wich I didn´t expect.

            <h3 class="about-subtitle"> Why did I choose to become a mom?</h2>

            <p>
                I always knew, that being a mom will be a part of my life. I prepared myself for this, 
                since I was a teenager. After having my first one I didn´t want to have a second one,
                but yeah, as you might heard, you´ll forget the pain and the struggels of pregnancy and laboring. 
                And also because my son was so easy to handle, I underestimated the dynamic of having two of them. 
                Although I would never undo my decisions. Even if it´s hard and I have to take myself back the most 
                of the time, it is worth it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="about-subtitle"> Where do I get the power to handle everything?</h2>

            <p>
                Honestly? I don´t have it. Without my husband and the Kindergarten I would be lost. For me it works fine
                to take every help that I can get. And I am learning everyday a lil bit more of being a better mom and wife, 
                while trying not to forget myself through all of it. 
            </p>
            <span> <br> <br> </span>
                
            <p> 
                Good Friends are very helpfull and also Playdates with 
                other mom´s who know your struggle. And for me coffe and a good breakfast is a secret tip to start the day with 
                good conditions. Finding your personal flow with everything is the key. Not to compare myself and celebrating 
                our achievements and having a good time is what helps me to carry on.
